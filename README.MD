# RED VS BLUE PROJECT #2


### Day 1 Pen Test
## **EXPLOITATION**

### **Discover target IP:**

To discover the target ip:

I first had to run an nmap scan


![nmap scan](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96896057/176231038-50e01034-7818-4772-9f70-7a10cb988e0e.png)


Eventually the scan returned which ports were vulnerable

Now that we know port 80 is vulnerable we open our Browser and navigate to the IP 192.168.1.105

Now once we are in the folder it gave us the instructions to connect to the server.
